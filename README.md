# Vadere

Vadere is an open source framework for the simulation of microscopic pedestrian dynamics. Vadere provides generic model classes and visualisation and data analysis tools for two-dimensional systems. A series of pedestrian locomotion models are already implemented in the framework that are also the basis for scientific publications. Namely the optimal steps model, the gradient navigation model, and the social force model are available for simulation studies. In addition to pedestrians, other systems including cars and granular flow can be introduced into the framework.

This software runs on Windows, OS X and Linux.

Vadere has been developed by [Prof. Dr. Gerta KÃ¶ster's](http://www.cs.hm.edu/die_fakultaet/ansprechpartner/professoren/koester/index.de.html)
research group at the [Munich University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hm.edu/) at the
[department for Computer Science and Mathematics](http://cs.hm.edu/).
However, we welcome contributions from external sources. 

The Vadere framework includes a mesh generator for unstructured high-quality 2D meshes called **EikMesh** which is described [here](https://gitlab.lrz.de/vadere/vadere/blob/master/VadereMeshing/README.md).

## Installation

### Dependencies

* Java 8
* Maven 3.0
* Git
* OpenCL

**Note:** Please, ensure that the Git executable can be found in the `PATH` variable of your operating system.

### Install OpenCL

Vadere uses computer's video card to speed up some computations. Therefore, following OpenCL components must be installed:

* the latest drivers for your OpenCL device(s)
* an OpenCL SDK

Please, use following instructions to set up the OpenCL components for your operating system:

* Windows: For further information using OpenCL on Windows [click here](https://streamcomputing.eu/blog/2015-03-16/how-to-install-opencl-on-windows/).
* OS X: OpenCL is pre-installed for OS X.
* Linux: Please refer to the installation manual of your Linux distribution. 
  * [Sources: OpenCL HowTo](https://wiki.tiker.net/OpenCLHowTo)
  * [Intel Driverpack (only driver needed)](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/opencl-drivers#latest_linux_driver)

## Run the Application

1. Get the Source: Run `git clone https://gitlab.lrz.de/vadere/vadere.git`.
2. Build the Application: Go to the project directory and run `mvn clean package` (or `mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip` if you want to skip the unit tests). This will build `vadere.jar`and `postvis.jar`. 
3. Start the Application: After building the application, you can start Vadere by running `java -jar VadereGui/target/vadere.jar`.
4. (If you only want to use the Postvisualization-Tool you can do so by running `java -jar VadereGui/target/postvis.jar`).

### Run Built-In Examples

With the following steps, you can run a simulation with one of the built-in examples from [VadereModelTests](VadereModelTests):

- start Vadere 
- *Project* > *Open* 
- choose `vadere.project` of one of the projects e.g. [TestOSM](VadereModelTests/TestOSM) and click *open*
- select the scenario on the left and press *run selected scenario*
